<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to my website.</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Denny, and I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. Born in Keller, Tx, I have been a native Texan my entire life.  Moving to Austin for UT's excellent Computer Science program has been very exciting and worthwhile.</p>

<p>I started programming 3 years ago in high school.  Since then, my passion for Computer Science has only grown.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals for this semester</h3>

<p>Jumping into the world of Computer Science can be overwhelming at first.  There are so many languages I have to learn and gain experience with.  Right now, I consider myself only proficient with Java, but I am working every day to gain experience in other languages and systems, namely Linux and Python.</p>  
<p>One big goal for me is to get an internship in Computer Science this summer.  Doing so will expose me to all sorts of new concepts and experience that will be invaluable to me later on.</p>

<p>When I am not in the Gates-Dell Complex programming, you can usually find me in one of the Butler's School of Music practice rooms.  I have been playing the trumpet for over 7 years and I am a part of the Longhorn marching band.  It's not all brass for me, though.  I am also a part of the Longhorn Jazz Ensemble playing piano.  Music has been a longlasting passion for me and it continues to grow on me to this day.  I probably know more about music theory than programming.</p>
<p>I also like to spend much of my free time outside.  I enjoy backpacking, hiking, golf, cycling, and basically anything that is considered exercise without it feeling like exercise.  When the weather is nice you may find me programming outside UT's Main Mall or Student Activity Center.  I find that nice weather helps me concentrate on classwork and makes me feel better overall.</p>
