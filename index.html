<p>Hello! My name is Denny, and I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. Born in Texas and raised in Keller, I have been a native Texan all my life. Moving to Austin for UT's excellent Computer Science program has been very exciting and worthwhile.</p>

<p>If you want to contact me, my information is posted below under "Contact info" or click the link to my resume on the left.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Goals for this semester</h3>

<p>Jumping into the world of Computer Science can be overwhelming at first.  There are so many languages I have to learn and gain experience with.  Right now, I consider myself only comfortable with Java, but I am working every day to gain experience in other languages and systems, namely Linux and Python.</p>  
<p>One big goal for me is to get an internship in Computer Science this summer.  Doing so will expose me to all sorts of new concepts that will be invaluable to me later on.</p>

<p>When I am not in the Gates-Dell Complex programming, you can usually find me in one of the Butler's School of Music practice rooms.  I have been playing the trumpet for over 7 years and I am a part of the Longhorn marching band.  It's not all brass for me, though.  I am also a part of the Longhorn Jazz Ensemble playing piano.  Music has been a longlasting passion for me and it continues to grow on me to this day.  I probably know more about music theory than programming.</p>
