<p>Hello! My name is Denny, and I am a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. Born in Texas and raised in Keller, I have been a native Texan all my life. Moving to Austin for UT's excellent Computer Science program has been very exciting and worthwhile.</p>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>When I am not in the Gates-Dell Complex programming, you can usually find me in one of the Butler's School of Music practice rooms. I have been playing the trumpet for over 7 years and I am a part of the Longhorn marching band. It's not all brass for me, though. I am also a part of the Longhorn Jazz Ensemble playing piano. Music has been a longlasting passion for me and it continues to grow on me to this day. I probably know more about music theory than programming.</p>
