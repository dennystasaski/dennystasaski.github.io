        <h3>Welcome to my website.</h3>

<p>Hello! My name is Denny, and I am a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Texas at Austin. Born in Keller, Tx, I have been a native Texan my entire life.  Moving to Austin for UT's excellent Computer Science program has been very exciting and worthwhile.</p>

<p>I started programming 6 years ago in high school.   Since then, my passion for Computer Science has only grown.</p>

<h3>Goals for this semester</h3>

<p>Jumping into the world of Computer Science can be overwhelming at first.  There are so many languages I have to learn and gain experience with.  Because of this, I am working every day to gain experience in different languages and systems.</p>  
<p>I am excited to have worked for American Express last summer as a Software Engineering Intern.</p>


<h3>Hobbies</h3>

<p>When I am not in the Gates-Dell Complex programming, you can usually find me in one of the Butler's School of Music practice rooms.  I have been playing the trumpet for over 9 years and I am a part of the Longhorn marching band.  It's not all brass for me, though.  I am also a part of the Longhorn Jazz Ensemble playing piano.  Music has been a longlasting passion for me and it continues to grow on me to this day.  I probably know more about music theory than programming.</p>
<p>I also like to spend much of my free time outside.  I enjoy backpacking, hiking, golf, cycling, and basically anything that is exercise without feeling like it.  When the weather is nice you may find me programming outside UT's Main Mall or Student Activity Center.  I find that nice weather helps me concentrate on classwork and makes me feel better overall.</p>
